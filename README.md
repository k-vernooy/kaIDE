# kaIDE
> A free online IDE for web development. See [k-vernooy.github.io/kaIDE](https://k-vernooy.github.io/kaIDE).
  
## Usage
Use like any other IDE. You can import existing projects from your computer, or create new ones.

This project is currently a static site so it can be hosted on GitHub pages, which means there is as of now no account system. When using, be sure to download your project, as there is (currently) no way to save online.

**I plan to migrate this project to PHP so that I can have a user and project saving system. This means that once I begin that, this project will not be found at the github hosting site, and will have to be moved. It will only be online once this process is complete.**

## Features
This project was built by a web developer, so it has all the features I enjoy in my normal applications. This includes:
  
- Syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion
- Built-in CSS color picker
- Emmet Abbreviations

## Contribution

I will welcome and merge pull requests after the first stable version, which will likely be **after I migrate to PHP**.
